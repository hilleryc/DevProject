                <p style="padding-bottom:20px;">
                    This project is about music generation based on chromatic visual input taken from an image or video.
                    The two mediums are linked via emotion labels assigned to different RGB values as well as musical modes.
                    I used a combination of MaxMSP, C, and basic JavaScript to complete the initial prototype of this project.

            <h2 class="project" style="padding-bottom:10px;">Sound Design for Animated Wolf Park Logo (February 2023-April 2023)</h2>
                <p style="padding-bottom:20px;">
                    From contact through a Purdue professor of mine I worked with a Lafayette conservation facility, Wolf Park, 
                    to add sound to an animated logo that they had created to be used for media for the park. I utilized wolf 
                    howls that were provided from the park and additional personal foley recordings taken on a Zoom H5 recorder 
                    and cleaned/changed them in iZotope to remove unwanted sound. I added and edited the recordings to fit to the 
                    animation in Reaper.

                <p style="padding-bottom:20px;">
                    For my senior design project in Multidisciplinary Engineering I collaborated with three other students
                    to find a problem frame in the space of the unhoused to contribute an engineering solution to. The group 
                    research and talked with local organizations and completed a simplistic solar power circuit design to add 
                    into the backpack to charge digital devices.

                <p style="padding-bottom:20px;">
                    At the Envision Center is where I learned a lot of the dialogue editing and sound design that I currently know.
                    During the course of learning from another student there, I completed a number of sounds for a simplistic 
                    2D platformer in Reaper. These included the player jumping, running over different surfaces, taking damage, 
                    shooting, dieing, picking up health, enemy taking damage, enemy dieing, destroying a block, a block hitting 
                    the ground, and the level end door to get to the next level.

            <h2 class="project" style="padding-bottom:10px; padding-top:20px;">Geiger Counter (Fall 2022)</h2>
                <p style="padding-bottom:20px;">
                    At the Envision Center, one of the projects that I worked on towards the end of my time working there was 
                    updating the previous sound that they had for a project utilizing a Geiger Counter. The previous sound was
                    noted to not be as accurate and did not sound as good as it could. To update this sound, I loaded the previous
                    one into Reaper and researched real Geiger Counter sounds as reference. I utilized isolation of different 
                    parts of white noise to be able to add the distinct grainy texture of the actual sound.
