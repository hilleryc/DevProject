        <p class="about-me">
            I am a recent graduate from Purdue University in Acoustical Engineering with a minor
             in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Through school and part-time work I have experience in sound,
              acoustical, and basic electrical design. Two projects that I worked on in school and work at the
               Purdue Envision Center initialized my interest in sound synthesis and procedural audio and is 
               something I hope to continue working with. </p>
